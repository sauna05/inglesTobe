             <h2>What is the Simple Present Tense</h2>
             <p>The simple present is a tense in English used to express habitual actions, 
                routines, permanent states, and general facts. It is used to talk about things 
                that happen regularly or that are always true.</p>

            <h2>Adverbs of Frequency:</h2>
            <p>In the simple present, we use several adverbs

            "Do" and "does" do not have meanings by themselves,

            They allow the use of the verb in its base form, without changes,
            even for the third person singular.
            As with the affirmative form, we separate the subjects into two
            groups to use the corresponding auxiliary DO/DOES.</p>
